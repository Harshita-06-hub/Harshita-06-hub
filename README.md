### Hi, I’m Harshita 👋

I am a **Pharmacy undergraduate researcher** working at the intersection of **biomedical research**, **drug discovery**, and **data-driven analysis of disease biology**. My work integrates **wet-lab experimentation** with **R-based statistical analysis** and **introductory AI-assisted workflows** to investigate drug response, disease heterogeneity, and translational research questions.

I am particularly interested in problems where **biology, computation, and pharmacology intersect**, and I aim to pursue a **research/thesis-based MSc program (Spring/Fall 2027)**.

## 📌 Selected Research & Projects

### 🔹 Bioinformatics & Data Science (Dry Lab)

**PCOS Clinical Data Analysis (R)**  
Designed an **end-to-end R analysis pipeline** to explore clinical and biochemical parameters in PCOS, including BMI, hormonal profiles, and follicular characteristics. The project emphasizes **reproducible research practices**, with structured data cleaning following **tidyverse principles** and automated reporting using **RMarkdown/Quarto**, enabling traceability from raw clinical data to final visualizations.  
This work generated biologically meaningful hypotheses related to **disease heterogeneity and subtype stratification**.

**Skills demonstrated:** R, biostatistics, data preprocessing, reproducible workflows, visualization

---

**AI-Driven Drug Design (International Hackathon Project)**  
Led a multidisciplinary team in designing **structure-based ligand candidates** targeting the μ-opioid receptor. Implemented a workflow combining **molecular docking**, **ADMET prediction**, and **scaffold clustering** to prioritize safety-optimized, non-addictive analgesic leads.  
The project resulted in **2nd place at an international biodesign hackathon**, among 70+ teams.

**Skills demonstrated:** structure-based drug design, ADMET filtering, computational screening, research leadership

### 🔹 Experimental Pharmacology (Wet Lab)

**Medicinal Plant Screening – *Adenanthera pavonina***  
Conducted **pharmacognostic evaluation and phytochemical screening** of *Adenanthera pavonina* seed extracts using cold maceration and double-solvent extraction methods. Assessed **antioxidant activity (DPPH assay)** and **antimicrobial potential**, with ongoing progression toward **cell-line cytotoxicity assays** for anticancer evaluation.  
Findings from this work have been **accepted for oral presentation at a national-level scientific conference**.

**Skills demonstrated:** pharmacognosy, phytochemistry, bioactivity assays, experimental design
